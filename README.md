<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/jvcanavarro/FAIR-Fast-Adapter-Identification-and-Removal/blob/master/utils/best5.png)

Based on 180 Pattern-Matching (PM) Algorithms Analisys the main idea of the project is to create a simple and fast tool to remove fragments of adapters located on FASTQ files. After testing all 180 algorithms utilizing the SMART Tool, we analysed the results and end up with 5 algorithms that had good performance with the approximated pattern length of a adapter (between 8 and 16 nitrogenous bases). QF43 and Sbndmq-4 had the best results, however Sbndmq-4 was slightly better with patterns of 8 nitrogenous bases, ending as our choice for this project. More informations about FAIR and 180 Pattern-Matching Algorithms Analysis can be found at: 



### Built With
The project was built mainly with C++, but some funcionalities are based on python scripts, including the 180 Pattern-Matching Algorithms Analisys present on this repository.
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.org)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

FAIR works with single, both forward/reverse, and interlaced fastq files to identify, trim and remove adapters and low-quality / N bases from sequences. It's possible to choose the quantity of threads during processing, require a Phred-offset quality identification and/or adapter identification. At the end of the execution a new fastq file is created on the directory choosed by the user with the segments of adapters removed and a additional file with the deleted bases. FAIR does not works yet with tar.gz files.

### Prerequisites

This repository can be built with any C++ compiler. During the conception of the project we used gcc with any major problem. Additionally, Python is necessary for some extra funcionalities.
* gcc
```sh
sudo apt-get install gcc
```
* python
```sh
sudo apt-get install python
```
If you want to execute algorithm evaluation located on `utils` some extra Python Frameworks are required, namely: pandas, matplotlib and numpy. Thankfully, you can install them all at once using pip.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jvcanavarro/FAIR-Fast-Adapter-Identification-and-Removal.git
```
2. Build with compiler
```sh
cd FAIR-Fast-Adapter-Identification-and-Removal
g++ source/main.cpp -o FAIR
```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Bellow are listed all FAIR avaiable parameters.

```FAIR - Fast Adapter Identification and Removal v1.0

Usage: /home/jvcanavarro/FAIR-Fast-Adapter-Identification-and-Removal [options] -o <output_dir>

Basic options:
-o/--output   <output_dir>   directory to store all the resulting files (required)
-h/--help                    prints this usage message
-v/--version                 prints version

Input data:
-s/--single        <filename>    file with unpaired reads
-f/--forward       <filename>    file with forward paired-end reads
-r/--reverse       <filename>    file with reverse paired-end reads
-i/--interlaced    <filename>    file with interlaced forward and reverse paired-end reads

Pipeline options:
--only-identify         runs only adapter identification (without removal)
--only-remove           runs only adapter removal (without identification)
                        need to set adapter(s) if this option is set
--trim                  trim ambiguous bases (N) at 5'/3' termini
--trim-quality          trim bases at 5'/3' termini with quality scores <= to
                        --min-quality value
--min-quality   <int>   minimal quality value to trim

Advanced options:
--adapter     <adapter>         adapter sequence that will be removed (unpaired reads)
                                required with --only-remove
--forward-adapter   <adapter>   adapter sequence that will be removed
                                in the forward paired-end reads (required with --only-remove)
--reverse-adapter   <adapter>   adapter sequence that will be removed
                                in the reverse paired-end reads (required with --only-remove)
-t/--threads    <int>           number of threads
                                [default: 4]
--phred-offset    <33 or 64>    PHRED quality offset in the input reads (33 or 64)
                                [default: auto-detect]
```

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/jvcanavarro/FAIR-Fast-Adapter-Identification-and-Removal)_



## Examples
You can test the program utilizing the samples `sample1.fastq` and `sample2.fastq` located at `data`. The new files are stored on `results`. Some common usages are listed bellow.

* Remove Adapters from Single FASTQ File with Adapter and Quality Identification
```sh
./FAIR --output results/ --single sample1.fastq
```
* Remove Adapters from Forward and Reverse FASTQ Files with Adapter and Quality Identification
```sh
./FAIR --output results/ --forward sample1.fastq --reverse sample2.fastq
```
* Remove Adapters from Forward and Reverse FASTQ Files without Adapters Identification
```sh
./FAIR --output results/ --forward sample1.fastq --reverse sample2.fastq --only-remove --forward-adapter CCCCCCC --reverse-adapter CCCATCC
```
* Remove Adapters from Single FASTQ File with Trim, Trim-Quality, Min-Quality, Number of Threads and Phred-Offset
```sh
./FAIR --output results/ --single sample1.fastq --trim --trim-quality 90 --min-quality 90 --threads 8 --phread-offset 33
```
